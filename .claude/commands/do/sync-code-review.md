## Quick Reference

### Workflow

1. **Fetch PR** → `gh pr view <number> --json comments,headRefName`
2. **Check for review** → Look for @claude code review comment
3. **If no review** → Comment `@claude` and poll for response (30s intervals, max 5min)
4. **Checkout branch** → `git checkout <headRefName>`
5. **Evaluate issues** → ACCEPT / PARTIAL / DEFER / REJECT
6. **Implement fixes** → For ACCEPT and PARTIAL issues
7. **Verify** → `pnpm build`
8. **Commit & push** → With structured message
9. **Comment on PR** → With response table
10. **Request re-review** → Comment `@claude` again to validate fixes

### Evaluation Criteria

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **ACCEPT** | Issue is valid, fix as suggested |
| **PARTIAL** | Issue is valid, will fix differently |
| **DEFER** | Valid but out of scope |
| **REJECT** | Based on incorrect assumption or intentional design |

### Evaluation Process

1. **Read the code review carefully** - Identify all reported issues (vulnerabilities, race conditions, bugs, style issues, etc.)
2. **Perform your own analysis** - For each issue, verify if it's correctly reported:
   - Is the issue real or a false positive?
   - Does the suggested fix make sense?
   - Are there better alternatives?
3. **Prioritize by severity** - Critical (security/data loss) > Medium (bugs) > Minor (style)
4. **Decide action for each** - ACCEPT, PARTIAL, DEFER, or REJECT with reasoning

### Response Format

```markdown
## Code Review Response

### Changes Implemented

| Issue | Severity | Status | Details |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| <title> | Critical/Medium/Minor | ✅ Fixed / ⏭️ Deferred / ❌ Won't Fix | <details> |

### Explanation for Deferred/Rejected Issues

> For each DEFER or REJECT, explain your reasoning to reach agreement with the reviewer.

### Verification

- [x] All accepted issues addressed
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Ready for re-review
